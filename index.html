	<p>One of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) primary forums for helping state and local governments implement cost-effective and productive energy systems for American homes, communities, businesses, and industries is the Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs Office (WIP). WIP is part of DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s “all of the above” national energy strategy to create greater energy affordability, security and resiliency. WIP is made up of two programs focused on state and local governments: Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and State Energy Program (SEP).</p>
	<p>WAP and SEP provide funding and technical assistance to states, territories, the District of Columbia, and Native American tribes to enhance energy security, advance state-led energy initiatives, maximize the benefits of decreasing energy waste, and reduce energy costs for low-income households. Each state is the decision maker and administrator for SEP and WAP program activities tailored to their unique resources, delivery and production capacity, and energy goals.</p>
